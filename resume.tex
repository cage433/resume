      {Developer}{Jan 2016 - present}
      \resumeItemListStart    
        \resumeItem{CTRM system}
        {Three ex-Trafigura colleagues and I started Topaz Technology. We are building a real time P\&L and risk management system aimed both at commodities traders and senior management. The system is based on the team's decades of experience in this area, and aims to avoid the common shortcomings of other systems in this market. The system we've written uses event sourcing (Akka persistence) to provide an audit trail, Akka cluster for scalability and MonetDB for real time pivoting on huge datasets. It supports oil/gas/coal/freight, soft derivatives and oil physicals. The system is written in Scala with the primary goals of very large scalability, easy extendability and ease of use.}

      \resumeItemListStart    
        \resumeItem{Metals derivatives VaR system}
          {I was part of a team of three hired to write a VaR system from scratch in Scala. As well as reporting VaR the system had an intuitive UI that allowed you to very quickly investigate in detail the reason behind the VaR numbers. Reports were shown as a pivot that allowed you to drill down on any values to see their composition. You could also run scenario analysis reports to help explain unintuitive results.}
          
        \resumeItem{Real time oil risk management}
          {This system grew out of the above VaR system and allowed real time pricing of oil options and other derivatives. It could be interacted with through Excel with pivots displaying either in Excel or in the pivot UI. The application was well liked and so grew to doing EOD reporting for books with complex derivative positions as it made explaining risk and P\&L easy. I ended up as the lead developer on this project overseeing all development and reviewing all PRs.}

      \resumeItemListStart
        \resumeItem{Power/gas/oil risk management system}
          {I was part of a small team of front-office developers who wrote this system, intially in Java, but switching to Scala in 2008. The systems primary goal was to value the optionality inherent in phsyical assets, such as power plants and hydroelectric dams. The system could value over 40 trade types on underlyings which included oil, gas, coal, power, emissions and FX.}
          
        \resumeItem{Grid for option valuation}
			{The requirement to be able to value physical assets on demand meant having to use a compute grid. We tried several commercial grid systems before writing our own as none of these met our requirements. The grid was written in Scala and had remote class loading, which meant no manual redeploying.}
          
        \resumeItem{Implied vol visualiser/calculator}
          {I worked with the head of the derivatives desk to write him an app for live implied vol calculating. Broker prices for different oil option strategies were input, implied vols backed out and the resulting interpolated vol surface shown.}

          {I was one of the founders, with three friends from university. We sold the company to Activision in 2007. The libraries we wrote allowed games to quickly add network state management as well as services like game discovery and user statistics (leaderboards). The library code was written in C++ with the server side code in Erlang and Python. }

    \resumeSubItem{Research Assistant at the Distributed Systems Group, Trinity College}
      {I developed a network topology and routing simulator for peer-to-peer systems (similar to PeerSim).
The simulator provided information on bandwidth usage, average number of hops required for searches and the probability of a successful search for different P2P routing algorithms.}
